1) Iteration constructs represent repetition of the same set of instructions 
until a specified condition has been met. Selection is an extremely important 
concept because we must select data 
and it's usage in the program depending on the output that is desired. For example, 
 We can  use
        switch (month) {
            case 11:
                printf("%d-NOV-0%d\n", year,day);
                break;
            case 12:
                printf("%d-DEC-0%d\n", year,day);
                break;
        }
Also for loop is available 
for(int month = 1; month <13; month++){
if(month == 11){printf("%d-NOV-0%d\n", year,day);}
else if (month == 12) {printf("%d-DEC-0%d\n", year,day);}
}
                The last 2 months are printed in both cases depending on the number of the month 
These codes are selecting data based on input and running a loop until the satisfactory result is achieved.
I am selecting values based on the variables input from the compiler to get the desired output.

2) The C language supports three selection constructs:i) optional path, ii) alternative paths 
iii) conditional expression
For validation I used conditional expressions to evaluate which case to run in the event for a particular 
month to be selected based on the assigned number for a particular month. I have also used conditional 
statements to run a contolled number of loops for output.
 


3) I tested and debugged my program numerous times depending on the necessary outcome. I sued iteration 
many times to get the specified output in the workshop. When my code wouldn't print a particular statement 
in a order I would check which part of my code is not coherent or written impropely.
  Iteration constructs represent repetition of the same set of instructions until a specified condition 
has been met.The simplest example of a structured construct is a sequence. When debugging it's important to check 
if any code within a loop is being repeated in error due to the positioning of the bracket.
