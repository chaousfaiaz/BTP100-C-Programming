1) Selection is an extremely important concept because we must select data 
The C language supports three selection constructs:i) optional path
ii) alternative paths iii) conditional expression
and it's usage in the program depending on the output that is desired. For example, 
 if(apple <= 0) {
                printf("ERROR: You must pick at least 1! \n");
            } else if (apple > apple_remaining) {
                printf("You picked too many... only %d more APPLE(S) are needed.\n", apple_remaining);
            } else {
                apple_remaining = apple_remaining - apple;
                if (apple_remaining != 0) {
                printf("Looks like we still need some APPLES...\n");
                }
some other examples are 
if (needed != 0) {
        int orange, orange_remaining = needed;
        do {
            printf("Pick some ORANGES... how many did you pick? : ");
            scanf("%d", &orange);
while(orange_remaining != 0);
These codes are selecting data based on input and running a loop until the satisfactory result is achieved.
I am selecting values based on the variables input from the compiler to get the desired output.

2)  Nested constructs interacts with the instance members of its outer class (and other classes).
 In effect, a static nested class is behaviorally a top-level class that has been nested in another 
top-level class for packaging convenience.The logic can easily be understood by a non-technical person 
as the key words such as if, else, do, while are easily understandable and the conditions they represent 
This is an example of a nested construct.

if(apple <= 0) {
                printf("ERROR: You must pick at least 1! \n");
            } else if (apple > apple_remaining) {
                printf("You picked too many... only %d more APPLE(S) are needed.\n", apple_remaining);
            } 

Snother nested construct is 
do {
     for(value = 1; value < orange_renmaining; 
            printf("Pick some ORANGES... how many did you pick? : ");
            scanf("%d", &orange);
while(orange_remaining != 0);

3) Iteration constructs represent repetition of the same set of instructions until a specified condition 
has been met.The simplest example of a structured construct is a sequence.  A sequence is either a simple
 statement or a code block. My favourite iteration construct uses a do-while loop to iterate through the body 
until a certain set of instructions are executed.
do {
            printf("Pick some ORANGES... how many did you pick? : ");
            scanf("%d", &orange);
while(orange_remaining != 0);
