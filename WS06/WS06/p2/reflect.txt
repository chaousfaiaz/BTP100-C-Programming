piece of work is entirely of my own creation.
*****************************************************************************
1) Iteration constructs represent repetition of the same set of instructions 
until a specified condition has been met. 
for(i = 0; i < forecast; i++) {
        printf("%3d  %5d    %5c    %11.2lf\n", i+1, priority[i], financed[i], costs[i]);
    }
}
When I gave an input for the number of declarations I used a for loop to iterate or pass 
value through index of all arrays in parellel to retreive values stored in that particular place through index. 
when i has the value of that in forecast and inside the arrays declaration I can access in parellel all the values 
that is tored in the array.
                


2) Array indexing begins at 1 rather than 0 so in order to match the positioning of the array index 
we let the iterating variable be initialized to 0.  
 


3) An array is a place holder where it stores data. Like a book shelf or a dressing room drawer an array stores 
values depending on type. when ever you want to access something in a dressing room drawer you have to pull out 
the drawer to obtain similaarly in an array we call the index or the position of that array to retreive the value.
